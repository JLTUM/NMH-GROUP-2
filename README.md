Initialise Git in Matlab:

1: Create Github Account
2: Install Git on your computer
2: Click on Link from Julian
3: Click on 'CloneorDownload' and copy the link (either HTTPS or SSH)
4: In Matlab browse to the folder where you want the code to be (has to be an empty folder
5: right click on a white spot in Matlab file manager --> source control --> manage files --> choose git and paste link to repository path --> retrieve
6: the files should now be on your computer if not you are silly

Use Git:

1: again rightclick --> source control --> branch: you should see a local master branch and multiple remore branches
2: Usually you work on local branches (meaning everything is saved on your computer) and if everything works you can push it to the remote branch (meaning into the internet where it is saved and others can sse it)
3 therefore: create local branch with your name (Branch Tag and creation) and select "switch" it as the branch you are working on (in the dropdown)
4: now work edit something in the file save and then rightlick on it --> source control --> view and commit changes (you have to add a comment here what you changed)
5: the file is now saved to you local git branch
6: if you again right click and push it will save everything to the remote branch (the one you are "switched" on

To update your local files rightclick --> fetch (this will let the computer know what is new in the repository) and then rightclick --> pull (this will actually load it to your computer)
If you create a new file you first have to add it to git by right click --> source control --> Add to git. then again commit and push.

! be carefull to always work on your branch !

If you dont understand it you are silly
